    <h2> CREATING  MY FIRST HTML DOCUMENT </h2>
    <p>Let's walk through the following steps. At the end of this tutorial, you will have made an HTML file that displays "Hello world" message in your web browser.</p>
    <h3> Step 1: Creating the HTML file</h3>
    Open up your computer's plain text editor and create a new file.
    <h3>Step 2: Type some HTML code</h3>
    Start with an empty window and type the following code:
  <pre>
    <code>
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; 
        &lt;html lang="en"&gt; 
        &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;A simple HTML document&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; 
        &lt;body&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Hello World!&lt;p&gt;
         &lt;/body&gt;
         &lt;/html&gt;
        
        </code>
  </pre>
  <h3>Step 3: Saving the file</h3>
    Now save the file on your desktop as "myfirstpage.html ".
   <h2><b>Explanation of code</b></h2> 
   You might wonder what that code was all about. Well, let's find out.
   <ul>
    <li>The first line &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; is the document type declaration. It instructs the web browser that this document is an HTML5 document. It is case-insensitive.</li>
   <li>The &lt;head&lt; element is a container for the tags that provides information about the document, for example, &lt;title&gt; tag defines the title of the document.</li>
<li>The &lt;body&gt;element contains the document's actual content (paragraphs, links, images, tables, and so on) that is rendered in the web browser and displayed to the user.</li>
    <p> You will learn about the different HTML elements in detail in the upcoming chapters. For now, just focus on the basic structure of the HTML document.
 </p>
 <strong>Note: <p>A DOCTYPE declaration appears at the top of a web page before all other elements; however the doctype declaration itself is not an HTML tag. Every HTML document requires a document type declaration to insure that your pages are displayed correctly.</p></strong>
 <strong> Tip: </strong><p> The <html>, <head>, and <body> tags make up the basic skeleton of every web page. Content inside the <head> and </head> are invisible to users with one exception: the text between <title> and </title> tags which appears as the title on a browser tab.</p>
</ul>
