        CSS is the key presentational technology that is used in website design.
    <HR>
        <P>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is a standard style sheet language used for describing the presentation (i.e. the layout and formatting) of the web pages.</P>
<p>Prior to CSS, nearly all of the presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the HTML markup (specifically inside the HTML tags); all the font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes had to be explicitly described within the HTML.</p>
<p>As a result, development of the large websites became a long and expensive process, since the style information were repeatedly added to every single page of the website.</p>
<p>To solve this problem CSS was introduced in 1996 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which also maintains its standard. CSS was designed to enable the separation of presentation and content. Now web designers can move the formatting information of the web pages to a separate style sheet which results in considerably simpler HTML markup, and better maintainability.</p>
<p>CSS3 is the latest version of the CSS specification. CSS3 adds several new styling features and improvements to enhance the web presentation capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Our CSS tutorial will help you to learn the fundamentals of the latest CSS3 language, from the basic to advanced topics step-by-step. If you're a beginner, start with the basic section and gradually move forward by learning a little bit every day.</p>

<h2>Advantages of Using CSS</h2>
<p>The biggest advantage of CSS is that it allows the separation of style and layout from the content of the document. Here are some more advantages, why one should start using CSS?</p>
<ul>
    <li> <b>CSS Save Lots of Time —</b> CSS gives lots of flexibility to set the style properties of an element. You can write CSS once; and then the same code can be applied to the groups of HTML elements, and can also be reused in multiple HTML pages./li>
        <li><b>Easy Maintenance — </b>CSS provides an easy means to update the formatting of the documents, and to maintain the consistency across multiple documents. Because the content of the entire set of web pages can be easily controlled using one or more style sheets.</li>
<li><b>Pages Load Faster — </b>CSS enables multiple pages to share the formatting information, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural contents of the documents. It significantly reduces the file transfer size, which results in a faster page loading.</li>

    </ul>
